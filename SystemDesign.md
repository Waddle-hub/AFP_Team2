## Introduction
A hi-level summary, which all members in the group should understand and decide,
if it's helpful for them to read other documents.
The necessity of the project, what to do with evaluating the project itself, the description of the problem and how all these
make the team work together with a strategy

## Purpose and Goals
This application should be made because nowadays so many salesmen use their cashier machine,
which is a kind of traditional way to deal with customers as it also takes time and needs effort,
so this application will make it easier and effortless.



## Proposed Scope\Architecture
Architecture:
The system will be developed in c#. the design will include buttons and text boxes to insert texts and numbers.

Design:
Image background on the screen as well as buttons with different colors. Red for delete, Green for add and yellow for edit.

Functionality:
First page will have just a simple login page and after we will have a simple dashboard.



## Reference Material
Throughout the process of system design we used amny reasources and references to make a very encompassing and successful system design document. we used :

https://www.its.dot.gov/research_archives/msaa/pdf/MSAA_SystemDesignFINAL.pdf System design template

https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~lacher/courses/COP3331/sdd.html as an example of how a system design document is written

## Summary
For the success of this system we will rely mostly on peer programming to minimise the errors that programmers may have. Our main focus will be on creating a user-friendly system that does not discriminate against gender, race, age, ethnic group and so on so our design will be highly maintained by allowing users to send emails should they wish to make comments or complaints about the design.
