__How the system should be and what it should not be  ?__

The system should be as simple as we can make it so that the user can easily use it,otherwise,it shouldn't be broken at any point,always working properly(maintenance) which means we should maintain our application to work properly and if any error shows up we have to catch it(try,catch exception).
 
======

__Constrains__ :
The application should have methods and function that can do all the operations needed like deleting or adding items, updating...etc also,it should have generic classes and methods.
